## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Tool input schema was passed under the v3/v4 `parameters` key inside `tool()` calls. AI SDK v5+ expects `inputSchema`; the old key was silently dropped, so every tool built via `defineTool()` or `Agent.asToolProvider()`/`asTool()` reached the model without a schema and was called with `{}`. Renamed the key in both `ToolProvider.createTool()` and `Agent.createToolInstance()`.

### Changed
- Replaced `as any` casts in `tool()` calls with narrowly-scoped `as unknown as Tool<TInput, TOutput>` casts. Catches future SDK key renames at compile time instead of letting them silently break tools.
- `ToolProviderConfig.providerOptions` is now typed as the SDK's `Tool["providerOptions"]` instead of `unknown`.
- `ToolProviderConfig.output` renamed to `outputSchema` to match the v6 `Tool` type. The previous name was silently dropped by AI SDK v6 anyway, so any caller relying on it was already broken.

### Added
- Behavioral regression test that asserts a subagent's input schema reaches the parent model as a populated `JSONSchema7` (not `{}`).
- Direct test for `Agent.asToolProvider()` covering the same `inputSchema` forwarding contract as `asTool()`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `gate(id, opts?)` — human-in-the-loop suspension points that throw `WorkflowSuspended` with a JSON-serializable snapshot
- `loadState(gateId, snapshot)` — type-safe workflow resumption; the gate ID string literal infers the response type from a compile-time `TGates` type map
- `ResumedWorkflow` class with typed `generate()` and `stream()` that accept the gate response
- `WorkflowSuspended` error class with a `snapshot` property containing the gate payload and pre-gate output
- `WorkflowSnapshot` interface for serializing/deserializing suspension state
- Gate options: `payload` (custom data for the human), `schema` (runtime response validation via any `.parse()` provider), `condition` (conditional suspension), `merge` (combine pre-gate output with response)
- Compile-time duplicate gate ID detection via conditional type constraint
- Runtime gate ID mismatch validation between `loadState` call and snapshot
- Descriptive error when gates are used inside nested workflows, `foreach()`, or `repeat()`
- Nested workflows — pass a `Workflow` or `SealedWorkflow` as a step via `step(workflow)`
- `foreach()` for iterating arrays through an agent or workflow, with optional `concurrency`
- `repeat()` for conditional loops with `{ until }` or `{ while }` (mutually exclusive, enforced at compile time)
- `WorkflowLoopError` thrown when `maxIterations` is exceeded (default: 10), catchable by `.catch()`
- `writer` automatically available in agent callbacks (`onStepFinish`, `onFinish`, `onError`) when running inside a streaming workflow
- `writer` available in `defineTool` execute via the third parameter when running inside a streaming workflow
- Automatic sub-agent streaming — `asTool()` uses `stream()` and merges to the parent writer when inside a streaming workflow, falls back to `generate()` otherwise
- `asToolProvider()` for deferred context resolution in agent-as-tool composition
- `Workflow.create({ id })` — optional workflow identifier, propagated through all builder methods
- `lastOutput` field in `catch()` callback (renamed from `input` for clarity)
- Runtime guard on `step(id, fn)` — throws if second argument is not a function
- `WorkflowBranchError` with `branchType` property for distinguishing predicate vs select failures
- `RepeatOptions`, `LoopCondition`, `ToolExecuteOptions` exported types

### Changed
- `SealedWorkflow` and `Workflow` now carry a 4th type parameter `TGates` for type-safe gate resumption
- Agent config now passes through all AI SDK `streamText`/`generateText` options (e.g. `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `maxRetries`, `headers`, `prepareStep`, `onChunk`)
- `toolChoice` and `stopWhen` are now `Resolvable` — accept static values or `(ctx, input) => value`
- `SealedWorkflow` exported as type only (cannot be constructed externally)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- Updated repository URL to `https://github.com/MOSMekawy/pipeai`
- Enabled manual triggering of the publish workflow (`workflow_dispatch`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- `Agent` — typed wrapper over AI SDK's `generateText`/`streamText` with resolvable config, context-aware tools, and structured output
- `Workflow` — typed pipeline builder with `step()`, `branch()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`
- `defineTool` — context-aware tool factory that injects runtime context into tool `execute` calls
- `asTool()` — compile an agent into a standard AI SDK `Tool` for use in another agent's tool loop
- Predicate branching (`branch([...cases])`) and key-based routing (`branch({ select, agents })`)
- Per-step hooks: `mapGenerateResult`, `mapStreamResult`, `onGenerateResult`, `onStreamResult`, `handleStream`
- Streaming support with automatic stream merging across pipeline steps
- `Workflow.from(agent)` shorthand for single-agent workflows
- `WorkflowBranchError` for unmatched branches
